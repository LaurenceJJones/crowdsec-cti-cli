# crowdsec-cti-cli

Welcome :wave: to the CrowdSec CTI CLI tool development repository.

In this repository, you will find the codebase for the CrowdSec CTI CLI tools.

Branches:

- `main`: The completed codebase for the CrowdSec CTI CLI tools.
- `dev`: The development branch for the CrowdSec CTI CLI tools.

We will be using the `dev` branch for development and the `main` branch for the completed codebase.

To start the workshop, please fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
```

Then, create a new branch from the `dev` branch.

```bash
git checkout -b dev
```

You are now ready to start the workshop. :tada:
